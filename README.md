# Introduction & Discription.
Andrew's Advanced AI, Is a script ment to improve roleplay, It's idea is to make the AI stop and pull over to the side of the road, faster, and more effective. With this script installed, the AI will be able to detect emergency lighting from over half a mile away (if siren is enabled) or, 0.3 of a mile (if siren is disabled) and they will come to a complete stop on the side of the road, so you don't have to leave your lane at all.

Unfortunatly trucks just don't move, so you will have to go around trucks.

This resource will also make sure emergency vehicles are properly allowed access though red lights, by making sure that the traffic will span out, and turn to the right.

### LEFT SIDE TURNING!
This resource will make sure all AI's reguardless, will always default to the right side, meaning the emergency vehcicle can pass on the left, not only but if you were driving on the shoulder, the AI will eaither turn to the left, to open the lane for the emergency vehicle, or stay stationary within the lane, to let the emergency vehicle pass.

This AI script will stop the AI from crashing into each other, and other vehicles also.

This script can be used on any form of server, that be any of the following.
